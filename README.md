A portfolio project.

The very first coding project I've ever done.

I followed a Skillshare class "Code your own portfolio - HTML & CSS basics" by Aga Naplocha.

Never coded before, so it was a whole new exciting experience! I loved it!

By the time I uploaded my first page, I started to think more and more seriously about changing my career into software engineering.

And here I am, half-way into coding bootcamp, on my way to become a Front-end Dev.
